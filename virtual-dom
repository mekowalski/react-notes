-Virtual DOM is a programmatic representation of the document we see in the browser
-Virtual DOM is a technique used by front-end libraries and frameworks, most notably React
-Build virtual representation of what the document should look like
-Best to touch and change the DOM as little as possible and do it with surgical precision
-Developers can think to have a document look like this and the VDOM will do the heavy lifting
-Virtual DOM does most of the work for the code, don't need to write much imperative code to update the
application
-Able to simply declare what the component should look like and how it should behave
-VDOM works very well and is used in many high-profile libraries and frameworks
-It is just a clever work around to the DOM being slow and the best bet for now

eg: index.js
ReactDOM.render(
  <App />
)

App.js
-Imports other Components that is all encompassed here
