-Tell React what the result should be and it'll do heavy lifting for the application

IMPERATIVE:
Process of hiring someone to paint the house
-Hire the person
-Tell them to open the paint can
-Dip the brush in the paint can
-Move the brush in a stroking fashion on the house walls
*Telling painter EXACTLY what to do, micromanage

1. Explicitly describe actions a program should take
2. Describe HOW a program should go about those actions
eg: removing las element from array
    -Access element as index arr.length - 1 from this array and erase it from memory
    -Resize the array to have 1 less element at the end
    -Return the new array

DECLARATIVE:
Process of hiring someone to paint the house
-Hire the person
-Tell them to paint the house walls this color
-They get it done
*No other explanation because the painter knows EXACTLY what to do
