-Declarative programming allows focus on what the application should look like, opposed to being concerned
with manually updating DOM
-Tell React what the result should be and it'll do heavy lifting for the application

IMPERATIVE:
Process of hiring someone to paint the house
-Hire the person
-Tell them to open the paint can
-Dip the brush in the paint can
-Move the brush in a stroking fashion on the house walls
*Telling painter EXACTLY what to do, micromanage

1. Explicitly describe actions a program should take
2. Describe HOW a program should go about those actions
eg: removing last element from array
    -Access element as index arr.length - 1 from this array and erase it from memory
    -Resize the array to have 1 less element at the end
    -Return the new array

DECLARATIVE:
Process of hiring someone to paint the house
-Hire the person
-Tell them to paint the house walls this color
-They get it done
*No other explanation because the painter knows EXACTLY what to do

1. Describe WHAT a program should accomplish, or what end result should be
2. Leaves the determination of HOW to get the end result up to the program
eg: removing last element from array
    -I have an array: [3, 6, 9]
    -I want an array like that but without the last element
    -Computer, make it happen
