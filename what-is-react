REACT: Declarative, efficient and flexible JS library for building user interfaces(UI)
-Allows creation of complex UIs from small, isolated pieces of code called COMPONENTS
-React has many kinds of COMPONENTS

REACT.COMPONENT Subclass
eg:
class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return(
      <div className='shopping-list'>
        <h1>Shopping List for {this.props.name}</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Groceries</li>
          <li>Shoes</li>
          <li>Bedding</li>
        </ul>
