REACT: Declarative, efficient and flexible JS library for building user interfaces(UI)
-Allows creation of complex UIs from small, isolated pieces of code called COMPONENTS
-React has many kinds of COMPONENTS

REACT.COMPONENT Subclass
eg:
class ShoppingList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return(
      <div className='shopping-list'>
        <h1>Shopping List for {this.props.name}</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Groceries</li>
          <li>Shoes</li>
          <li>Bedding</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
*ShoppingList is a React COMPONENT Class or React COMPONENT type

-Use COMPONENTS to tell React what to display on the screen
-When data changes, React will update and re-render COMPONENTS
-COMPONENT takes in params called PROPS(properties) and returns a hierarchy of vies to display via RENDER()
 method
-RENDER() method returns description of what to see on screen, returning a React element
-JSX makes structures easier to write
  eg:
  <div /> syntax transformed at build time to React.createElement('div')

  EQUIVALENT:
  return React.createElement('div', {classnName: 'shopping-list'},
    React.createElement('h1', //h1 children),
    React.createElement('ul', //ul children)
  )
