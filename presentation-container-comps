Separation of Presentational and Container Components help make application easier to understand
Also allows easy reuse of components

                  PRESENTATIONAL              | CONTAINER
       Purpose  | How things LOOK             | How things WORK
Aware of Redux  | NO                          | YES
  To read data  | Read data from props        | Subscribe to Redux state
To change data  | Invoke callbacks from props | Dispatch Redux actions
   Are written  | By hand                     | Usually generated by React Redux

-Most written presentational components will be present but a few container components are needed to connect
 to the Redux store
