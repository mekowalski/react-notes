Dynamic Components: can describe a template of HTML and fill in variable data

MAKING COMPONENTS DYNAMIC
-Content: Contains the content of article
-Comment: Contains a User's comment
-Article: top level React component responsible for rendering both Content and Comment

1. Create Content comp
  eg:
  class Content extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          {this.props.articleText}
        </div>
      )
    }
  }
  *Snippet shows how to describe variables in component's render() method
  *{this.props.articletext} tells React to place value this line of code represents within a <div>
  *where does {this.props.articleText} come from


PASSING INFORMATION
-React allows passing units of information from parent comp down to child comp called PROPS

2. Pass info from Parent to Child via PROPS
  eg:
  class Article extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          <Content articleText={'Dear Reader: The Reformation clothing line is innovative with their
          selection of sustainable fabric and holistic approach on creating a higher standard in the
          fashion industry.'}/>
        </div>
      )
    }
  }
  *Render Content comp, assigning an accessible value to articleText from within Content comp as
   this.props.articleText


EXPANDING APPLICATION
-Comment comp is still needed for each comment in Article

3. Create Comment comp
  eg:
  class Comment extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          {this.props.commentText}
        </div>
      )
    }
  }
  *When used, will display content inherited, allowing passing of different content to multiple Comment
   comps
