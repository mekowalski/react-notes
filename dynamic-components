Dynamic Components: can describe a template of HTML and fill in variable data

MAKING COMPONENTS DYNAMIC
-Content: Contains the content of article
-Comment: Contains a User's comment
-Article: top level React component responsible for rendering both Content and Comment

1. Create Content comp
  eg:
  class Content extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          {this.props.articleText}
        </div>
      )
    }
  }
  *Snippet shows how to describe variables in component's render() method
  *{this.props.articletext} tells React to place value this line of code represents within a <div>
  *where does {this.props.articleText} come from


PASSING INFORMATION
-React allows passing units of information from parent comp down to child comp called PROPS

2. Pass info from Parent to Child via PROPS
  eg:
  class Article extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          <Content articleText={'Dear Reader: The Reformation clothing line is innovative with their
          selection of sustainable fabric and holistic approach on creating a higher standard in the
          fashion industry.'}/>
        </div>
      )
    }
  }
  *Render Content comp, assigning an accessible value to articleText from within Content comp as
   this.props.articleText


EXPANDING APPLICATION
-Comment comp is still needed for each comment in Article

3a. Create Comment comp
  eg:
  class Comment extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          {this.props.commentText}
        </div>
      )
    }
  }
  *When used, will display content inherited, allowing passing of different content to multiple Comment
   comps

3b. Add comment with reusable comps and passing content data down to the Comment comp
  eg:
  class Article extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          <Content articleText={'Dear Reader: The Reformation clothing line is innovative with their
          selection of sustainable fabric and holistic approach on creating a higher standard in the
          fashion industry.'}/>
          <Comment commentText={'I fully support The Reformation!!! - UserRefLover'}/>
          <Comment commentText={'Yes, agreed! plus the Reformation has feminine, flirty, fun pieces. -
          AnotherTRlover'}/>
          <Comment commentText={'A universal truth. - Noam Chimsky'}/>
        </div>
      )
    }
  }
  *Information is passed from Parent to many Child comps
  *React renders REAL-LIVE DOM Elements when code is put into new appliation
  *Provided are legitimate classes, ids, minor CSS bt better visual display

-Dynamic components are CORE to REACT programming
-React app consists of combined React comps that are smarter and bigger

NOTE ON THE PAST
-React has spanned transition from ES5 to ES6, some React code will look different
-React.createClass() was previously used to define Classes and extend React.Component
-Current replacement is class Classname extends React.Component()
