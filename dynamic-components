Dynamic Components: can describe a template of HTML and fill in variable data

MAKING COMPONENTS DYNAMIC
-Content: Contains the content of article
-Comment: Contains a User's comment
-Article: top level React component responsible for rendering both Content and Comment

1. Create Content comp
  eg:
  class Content extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          {this.props.articleText}
        </div>
      )
    }
  }
  *Snippet shows how to describe variables in component's render() method
  *{this.props.articletext} tells React to place value this line of code represents within a <div>
  *where does {this.props.articleText} come from
