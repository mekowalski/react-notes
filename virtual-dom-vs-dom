DOM manipulation is heart of modern web but slower than most JavaScript operations
Slowness is worsened due to JavaScript framework updates on the DOM more than necessary
EXAMPLE:
  -A list of 9 items
  -Cross out one of the items
  -Most JavaScript frameworks rebuild the entire list
  -9 times the work than necessary, since only 1 item changed

Rebuilding is not a big deal but modern sites use huge amounts of DOM manipulation & becomes
  inefficient


VIRTUAL DOM
Every DOM object in React has a corresponding virtual DOM object
Virtual DOM is representation of a DOM object, a carbon copy
DOM and Virtual DOM have same properties but VDOM lacks power to directly change on screen
VDOM manipulation is faster because nothing gets hassled on screen
EXAMPLE:
  -VDOM manipulation is like editing a blueprint
  -Instead of moving rooms in an actual house


PROS OF VIRTUAL DOM
-Diffing: React figures out exactly which virtual DOM objects have changed with comparison of new
VDOM and a pre-update version
-Once React knows which DOM objects have changes, those objects are they only updates on the real
DOM
-Changes are then on the screen after update
