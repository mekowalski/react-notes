-JavaScript is an evolving language
-Over time there have been several iterations, changes to incorporate more features, language construct(ES6)
-This resembles the confounded mirroring the story of Tower of Babel

-Babel: makes all JS versions emit a common standard code
-Babel gains popularity because it compiled/transpiled newer ES6 features into the older ES5
-Currently browsers implement ES6 syntax


BABEL IMPORTANCE
-Although current browsers integrate ES6, developers have realized the processing of their code with Babel
-Code written conveniently and neatly can be compiled in Babel into verbose, compliant JS code
-Non-standard JSX transformed into compliant JS
eg: Babel turns JSX into normal JS written with React library
  JSX
  var profile = (
    <div>
      <imag src='avatar.png' className='profile' />
      <h3>{[user.firstName, user.lastName].join(' ')}</h3>
    </div>
  )

  Babel compiled
  var profile = (
    React.createElement('div', null,
    React.createElement('img', {src: 'avatar.png', className: 'profile'}),
    React.createElement('h3', null, [user.firstName, user.lastName].join(' ')))
  )

-First JSX block is a mixture of HTML and plain JS
-Second block transformed into valid JS syntax after Babel compile
