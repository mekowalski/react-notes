EXAMPLE: Simple app rendering 3 components(CompYellow, CompGreen and CompWhite)
-When Fully rendered, component structure should look like:
  APP
   |___CompYellow
   |      |___CompGreen
   |      |      |___CompWhite
   |      |      |___CompWhite
   |      |
   |      |___CompGreen
   |             |___CompWhite
   |             |___CompWhite
   |___CompYellow
          |___CompGreen
          |      |___CompWhite
          |      |___CompWhite
          |
          |___CompGreen
                 |___CompWhite
                 |___CompWhite

src/randomColorGenerator.js has a few helper functions to help generate random colors

2. When a component changes an attribute, all its children should follow a similar action
3. Components of same level won't communicate directly
