Real power is in updating state
Use this.setState(), available to all React components instead of directly modifying with this.state

*code along in react-updating-state*
*refer to scr/components/ClickityClick.js*
*refer to src/index.js*

-To update state, use this.setState()
// src/components/ClickityClick.js
...
//after defining initial state

handleClick = () => {
  this.setState({
    hasBeenClicked: true
  })
}

...


-Object will get merged with the current state when using this.setState() and passing in an object,
once state updates, component re-renders automatically
-State only merges on the first level


SETTING STATE IS NOT SYNCHRONOUS
-It may seem that setting state is synchronous because it updates right away but it is NOT synchronous
-State changes happen asynchronously although they appear to instantly update


STATE CHANGES VS PROPS CHANGES
-State and Props changes will both trigger re-render in React component
-State changes though, will only happen internally due to components changing their own state
-Props changes occur eternally due to changes in the prop values being passed in
