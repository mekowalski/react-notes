PROPS ARE GOOD BECAUSE...
-State is bad(Somewhat, not really)
-Using state in React comps is necessary at times
-State has the ability to explicitly/reliably update component's features making it a powerful React
 feature
-Overall state creates complexity

-Often, an application needs state but the human brain struggled ti parse and track state

PROPS: provide a way to minmize  number of components in app that carry and manage state
-Aloso provides a method to reduce the total 'surface area' of the app that is 'stateful'
