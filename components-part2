*If idea and application of components don't click immediately, DO NOT WORRY*
React Doc: 'Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces and think about each piece
in isolation'

-Components modularize both Functionality and Presentation in code
-Little packages that help keep everything in app code organized and predictable


REACT APPLICATION IDEA
-Article describing how The Reformation clothing line is innovative with their selection of sustainable
 fabric and holistic approach on creating a higher standard in the fashion industry
-Article should have a display of comments made by readers that may naturally agree with the article or have
 classic heated discussions
-The application should display the opinion/responses/comments to the article
1. Write the components
  -Make a component to showcase an opinion
  eg:
  class Article extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          Dear Reader: The Reformation clothing line is innovative with their selection of sustainable
           fabric and holistic approach on creating a higher standard in the fashion industry.
        </div
      )
    }
  }
  a. Declared new class: Article
  b. Class extends React's Component class(providing built in methods and attributes)
  c. RENDER() method defined and return is explicitly provided

2. Use the component
