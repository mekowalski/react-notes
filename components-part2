*If idea and application of components don't click immediately, DO NOT WORRY*
React Doc: 'Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces and think about each piece
in isolation'

-Components modularize both Functionality and Presentation in code
-Little packages that help keep everything in app code organized and predictable


REACT APPLICATION IDEA
-Article describing how The Reformation clothing line is innovative with their selection of sustainable
 fabric and holistic approach on creating a higher standard in the fashion industry
-Article should have a display of comments made by readers that may naturally agree with the article or have
 classic heated discussions
-The application should display the opinion/responses/comments to the article
1. Write the components
  -Make a component to showcase an opinion
  eg:
  class Article extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          Dear Reader: The Reformation clothing line is innovative with their selection of sustainable
           fabric and holistic approach on creating a higher standard in the fashion industry.
        </div
      )
    }
  }
  a. Declared new class: Article
  b. Class extends React's Component class(providing built in methods and attributes)
  c. RENDER() method defined and return is explicitly provided
-When React creates element and adds it to the DOM, the HTML should be a <div> on the page with lines 22-23

  -Make a component to display user comments
  eg:
  class Comment extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          Naturally, I, UserWhatever, agree with this article.
        </div>
      )
    }
  }
  *Same component set up as Article, explained in L28-30*
-Both examples are JavaScript interpreted by React within the render()'s return() statement and displaying
 plain HTML that browsers know how to represent to the user

2. Use the component
  -Make use of component's render() method, every React app has top level component(s)
  -Often times than not, top level component is called App
  eg:
  class App extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          <Article />
          <Comment />
        </div>
      )
    }
  }
