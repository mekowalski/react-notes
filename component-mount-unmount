SETUP AND CLEANUP
Mounting is to creation/setup and unmounting is to deletion/cleanup
eg: having a picnic
  Mount:
  -find clear and leveled ground
  -lay down picnic blanket
  Unmount:
  -take all things off blanket
  -clear up any garbage
  -put things in basket and head out


MOUNTING
Mounting gives access to 2 lifecycle methods: componentWillMount and componentDidMount

COMPONENTWILLMOUNT
-Called once immediately before the component is rendered, performs any state changes needed before
initial render
EXAMPLE: keep the time and date when component was created, set up in 'componentWillMount'
  componentWillMount() {
    this.setState({startDateTime: new Date(Date.now())})
  }


COMPONENTDIDMOUNT
-Also only called once, immediately after render() method has taken place
-Used to perform any DOM manipulation of data-fetching that the component may need
EXAMPLE: a weather app that fetches data on current weather and displays it to user, update data
every 15 seconds without page refresh
  componentDidMount() {
    this.interval = setInterval(this.fetchWeather, 15000)
  }


UNMOUNTING
Only one lifecycle method to delete or cleanup: componentWillUnmount

COMPONENTWILLUNMOUNT
-Last function to be called immediately before the component is removed from the DOM
-Cleaup for any DOM-elements or timers created in 'componentWillMount'
EXAMPLE: (weather app fetching data) clear the interval so the weather API would no longer get
called every 15 seconds
  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.interval)
  }


Mounting and unmounting steps are important for ensuring React components get set up and initialized
nicely
