SETUP AND CLEANUP
Mounting is to creation/setup and unmounting is to deletion/cleanup
eg: having a picnic
  Mount:
  -find clear and leveled ground
  -lay down picnic blanket
  Unmount:
  -take all things off blanket
  -clear up any garbage
  -put things in basket and head out


PRE-MOUNTING
-Constructor is the first function called upon instantiating ANY class in JS, not just React
 components
-Acts are the perfect place to set initial state of component
eg:
  constructor() {
    super()
    this.state = {
      key: 'value'
    }
  }

  state = {
    key: 'value'
  }
*SUPER is called to execute constructor function inherite from React.Component while adding
 functionality


MOUNTING
Mounting gives access to 2 lifecycle methods: componentWillMount and componentDidMount

COMPONENTWILLMOUNT
-Called once immediately before the component is rendered, performs any state changes needed before
initial render
EXAMPLE: keep the time and date when component was created, set up in 'componentWillMount'
  componentWillMount() {
    this.setState({startDateTime: new Date(Date.now())})
  }
*Largely considered problematic and may soon be deprecated
-Preferable to use Constructor for setting an initial state for component
-Preferable to user componentDidMount for setting state using data from async request


COMPONENTDIDMOUNT
-Also only called once, immediately after render() method has taken place
-Used to perform any DOM manipulation of data-fetching that the component may need
EXAMPLE: a weather app that fetches data on current weather and displays it to user, update data
every 15 seconds without page refresh
  componentDidMount() {
    this.interval = setInterval(this.fetchWeather, 15000)
  }


UNMOUNTING
Only one lifecycle method to delete or cleanup: componentWillUnmount

COMPONENTWILLUNMOUNT
-Last function to be called immediately before the component is removed from the DOM
-Cleanup for any DOM-elements or timers created in 'componentWillMount'
-Extremely important to clean up all things that were set up in mounting stage
-Not doing so will lead to consequences that may crash the application
EXAMPLE: (weather app fetching data) clear the interval so the weather API would no longer get
called every 15 seconds
  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.interval)
  }


Mounting and unmounting steps are important for ensuring React components get set up and initialized
nicely
