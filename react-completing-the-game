COMPLETING THE GAME
(Follow up from what-is-react and the TTT game)

LIFTING STATE UP
-To check for a winner, maintain the value of each 9 squares in one location
-Best approach is to store the Game's state in the Parent Board Component
-Board will be able to tell each Square what to display by passing a PROP

-Collect data from multiple Children, or have two Child Components communicate with each other
-Do this by declaring the Shared STATE in their Parent Component
-Parent Component can pass STATE back down to Children by using PROPS
-Doing so will keep Child Components in sync with each other and Parent Component

-Add constructor to Parent Component to set initial state
*Follow with react-ttt-app
-When filling the board later, it will look something like:

[
  'O', NULL, 'X',
  'X', 'X', 'O',
  'O', NULL, NULL
]

-Current Board renderSquare():
renderSquare(i) {
  return <Square value={i}/>;
}
*Beginning, value props passed down from Board to show numbers 0-8 in every Square
*Another previous step, numbers were replaces with an 'X' mark determined by the Square's own state
*Square currently ignores the value prop passed to it by Board

-Need to use prop passing mechanism again
-Modify Board to instruct each individual Square about its current value('X', 'O' or null)
